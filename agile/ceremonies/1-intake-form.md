# Sustaining Engineering Intake Form: Your Gateway to Getting Work Done

## What is it?

The Sustaining Engineering Intake Form is your **single, most effective way to submit requests**—be it for bug fixes, enhancements, investigations, or new initiatives—to the Sustaining Engineering team.

## Why use it? (Its Intention)

This form is designed to:

* **Bring Clarity Instantly:** It helps you provide clear, essential information right from the start.
* **Speed Up Prioritization:** By capturing the business impact and urgency, it allows the team to quickly assess and prioritize your request.
* **Streamline Review:** Gives the team (Product Owners and Engineers) the initial context needed to understand your needs and decide on the best course of action.
* **Keep Things Organized:** Centralizes all incoming requests, ensuring every initiative is considered through a consistent and traceable process.

## What kind of info does it ask for? (And why it matters for your request)

The form asks for key details that directly help turn your request into an actionable backlog item:

1. **Who's Asking?** (Requestor Email): So we know who to talk to for follow-ups.
2. **What's the Request?** (Request/Initiative): A clear summary that helps us categorize and title the work.
3. **Why is it Needed?** (Problem Being Solved): The core reason—this helps us understand the value and purpose.
4. **Any Dependencies?** (Dependencies): Crucial for planning and understanding potential roadblocks or impacts on other teams.
5. **What's the Impact?** (Business Impact): Helps us prioritize—what happens if we do this, or if we don't?
6. **Got a Solution Idea?** (Recommended Solutions): Your initial thoughts are welcome, though the team will determine the final technical path.
7. **What Does Success Look Like?**: Your vision of a successful outcome helps us define clear goals and testable conditions (Acceptance Criteria).
8. **Got Files?** (Attachments): Screenshots, mockups, or docs can be super helpful.
9. **Need it by When?** (Completion Date): Your desired timeline (note: this is for info, not a guarantee).

## What happens after you submit? (How it feeds the backlog)

1. **Submission:** You fill out the form.
2. **Review:** Our Product Owner/team leads review your request.
3. **Clarification:** We might reach out if we have questions.
4. **Ticket Creation:** If it's a go, we create a formal ticket (e.g., in JIRA).
5. **Prioritization & Grooming:** Your request joins our backlog, gets prioritized, and then goes through our detailed grooming process to get it "sprint-ready."
