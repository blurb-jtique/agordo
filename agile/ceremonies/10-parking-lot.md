# Parking Lot: Focused Problem-Solving Sessions

## 1. Purpose and When to Use

* **Purpose:** The "Parking Lot" is a dedicated, time-boxed meeting for collaborative problem-solving, deep dives into technical challenges, or unblocking complex issues that cannot be adequately addressed during shorter, more focused meetings like the Daily Stand-up. It formalizes the "problem-solving offline" approach.
* **When to Trigger a Parking Lot Session:**
  * **Pattern of Assistance Needed:** When the team observes a recurring theme of questions, blockers, or a need for deeper technical discussion around a specific PBI, feature, or technical challenge.
  * **Stable Velocity Context:** This mechanism is particularly useful once the team has achieved a relatively stable velocity, as it indicates that recurring needs for assistance might be due to genuine complexity rather than general sprint instability. However, it can be used judiciously even before perfect stability if a clear need for focused, collaborative problem-solving arises for a critical issue.
  * **Beyond Daily Stand-up Scope:** When an issue raised in a Daily Stand-up clearly requires more than a few minutes of discussion and involves multiple team members.
  * **Unblocking Critical Work:** When a PBI crucial for the Sprint Goal is blocked and requires collective brainpower to resolve.

## 2. Scheduling and Signaling the Need

* **24-Hour Advance Scheduling (Ideal):** Aim to schedule Parking Lot sessions at least 24 hours in advance. This allows participants to prepare.
* **Use of Placeholders/Signaling Mechanism:**
  * Establish a lightweight way to signal the need for a Parking Lot session. This could be:
    * A designated "Parking Lot" section on a physical or digital team board where topics are noted.
    * A specific tag or label in your issue tracker (e.g., JIRA) for items needing Parking Lot discussion.
    * A dedicated Slack channel or thread for proposing Parking Lot topics.
  * The team member identifying the need proposes the topic and, if possible, suggests a suitable time slot (using agreed-upon team placeholders for such meetings).
* **Time-boxing:** Clearly define the timebox for the session (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour) to maintain focus.

## 3. Preparation for Participants

* **Clear Topic:** The agenda/topic for the Parking Lot session should be clearly communicated when the meeting is scheduled.
* **Relevant Information:** Participants expected to contribute significantly should review any relevant PBIs, documentation, code, or error logs beforehand.
* **Come Prepared with Questions/Ideas:** Encourage attendees to think about the problem and potential solutions or questions before the session.

## 4. Participants

* **Core Group:** Include only those team members directly involved in or essential for solving the specific problem. This keeps the meeting focused and efficient.
* **Topic Proposer:** The person who identified the need for the Parking Lot session should attend and provide context.
* **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** If the problem requires specific expertise (e.g., a particular microservice, database knowledge, a specific part of Blurby), ensure the relevant SME is invited.
* **Facilitator (Optional but Recommended):** One person can facilitate to keep the discussion on track, manage time, and ensure all voices are heard.

## 5. Running the Parking Lot Session (Agenda/Structure)

* **A. State the Problem/Goal (5-10 mins):**
  * The topic proposer clearly articulates the problem, the goal of the session, and any relevant background.
* **B. Collaborative Discussion & Brainstorming (Main part of the session):**
  * Open discussion, idea generation, whiteboarding (physical or virtual).
  * Focus on understanding the root cause and exploring potential solutions or next steps.
  * Encourage diverse perspectives.
* **C. Define Actionable Next Steps (5-10 mins):**
  * This is crucial. The session must conclude with clear, actionable next steps.
  * What will be done? Who will do it? By when (if applicable)?
  * These actions might become new tasks on the sprint backlog, updates to existing PBIs, or a plan for further investigation.
* **D. Summarize (Briefly):** Quickly recap the decisions made and the agreed-upon actions.

## 6. Outcomes of a Successful Parking Lot Session

* **Clarity:** Increased understanding of the complex issue or blocker.
* **Actionable Plan:** A clear set of next steps to address the problem or move forward.
* **Unblocked Work:** Ideally, the session helps unblock a PBI or a team member.
* **Shared Knowledge:** Knowledge is shared among participants.
* **Decision (if applicable):** A decision is made regarding a technical approach or solution.

## 7. Key Practices to Ensure Effectiveness

* **Stay Focused:** Adhere to the stated topic. If new, unrelated issues arise, add them to a *new* parking lot list for a separate session.
* **Time-Consciousness:** Respect the timebox. If more time is needed, schedule a follow-up.
* **One Conversation at a Time:** Ensure effective communication by having one person speak at a time.
* **Visual Aids:** Use whiteboards, shared documents, or virtual collaboration tools to visualize problems and solutions.
* **Action-Oriented:** The primary goal is to generate actionable outcomes, not just to discuss.
* **Document Outcomes:** Briefly document the key discussion points, decisions, and action items (e.g., in Confluence, linked to the relevant PBI, or in shared team notes).
* **Psychological Safety:** Foster an environment where all participants feel comfortable sharing ideas, asking "silly" questions, and challenging assumptions respectfully.
