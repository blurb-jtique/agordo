# Running the Sprint: Practices & Key Focus Areas

## 1. Focus on the Sprint Goal

* **Guiding Star:** The Sprint Goal is the primary objective. All activities and decisions during the Sprint should align with achieving this goal.
* **Daily Reaffirmation:** Briefly revisit the Sprint Goal during Daily Stand-ups to ensure continued alignment.

## 2. Effective Daily Stand-ups

* **Purpose:** A quick, daily synchronization meeting for the Engineers to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the plan for the next 24 hours. It's not a status report to managers.
* **Structure (The 3 Questions):**
  * What did I accomplish yesterday that helped the team meet especially the Sprint Goal?
  * What will I do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?
  * Do I see any impediments or blockers preventing me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
* **Time-boxed:** Keep it short (e.g., 15 minutes).
* **Problem Solving Offline:** If detailed problem-solving is needed, schedule a separate meeting with relevant team members after the stand-up. [See **Parking Lot** proposal]

## 3. Collaboration and Communication

* **Prioritize Collaboration Over Raw Effort:** Encourage teamwork, pairing, and swarming on complex items. Don't let individuals struggle in isolation.
* **Open Communication:** Maintain open and frequent communication within the team. Use agreed-upon channels (e.g., Slack) effectively.
* **Transparency:** Make progress and impediments visible (e.g., on the sprint board).

## 4. Managing the Sprint Backlog

* **Engineer Ownership:** The Sprint Backlog is owned and managed by the Engineers. They decide how best to accomplish the work.
* **Task Breakdown:** Continue to break down PBIs into smaller tasks as needed throughout the Sprint to refine the plan.
* **Update the Board:** Keep the sprint board (e.g., JIRA board) updated in real-time to reflect the current status of work. This is crucial for transparency and for the Daily Stand-up.

## 5. Addressing Impediments and Blockers

* **Raise Early:** Identify and communicate impediments or blockers as soon as they arise, typically during the Daily Stand-up or immediately to relevant team members.
* **Swarm if Necessary:** If a blocker is critical, the team may need to "swarm" to resolve it quickly.
* **Escalate Appropriately:** If the team cannot resolve an impediment themselves, escalate it to the Scrum Master (if applicable) or relevant manager (e.g., Craig) for assistance.

## 6. Adherence to Definition of Done (DoD)

* **Quality Standard:** Ensure all completed work meets the team's agreed-upon Definition of Done. This is non-negotiable for an item to be considered truly "done."
* **Early Verification:** Don't wait until the end of the Sprint to verify if work meets the DoD. Integrate quality checks throughout the development process.

## 7. Protecting the Sprint

* **Minimize Disruptions:** The team should be shielded from external disruptions as much as possible to allow them to focus on the Sprint Goal.
* **Scope Stability:** Avoid adding new work (scope creep) to the Sprint once it has started. If new, urgent work arises, it should be discussed with the Product Owner. It may necessitate removing an equivalent amount of existing work or, in rare cases, re-negotiating the Sprint Goal.

## 8. Continuous Learning and Improvement

* **Inspect and Adapt:** The Sprint is an opportunity to learn. If something isn't working well (e.g., a process, a tool), make a note to discuss it in the Sprint Retrospective.
* **Feedback:** Provide and be open to constructive feedback within the team.

### **Things to Avoid During the Sprint**

1. **Changing the Sprint Goal:**
   * Once set, the Sprint Goal should not change. If the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, the Product Owner can cancel the Sprint.
2. **Adding Unplanned Work (Scope Creep) without Discussion:**
   * Resist the urge to add new items to the Sprint Backlog after Sprint Planning unless it's a critical issue (like a Hotfix) and has been discussed and agreed upon with the Product Owner and the team, potentially involving a scope trade-off.
3. **Working in Silos / "Hero" Contributions:**
   * Avoid situations where team members work in isolation for extended periods without communication or collaboration, especially on complex tasks.
   * Discourage "hero" efforts where one person tries to do everything, as this can lead to burnout and knowledge gaps.
4. **Ignoring Blockers:**
   * Do not let impediments fester. Address them promptly. If a task remains blocked for an extended period without a clear path to resolution, it needs urgent attention and potentially re-evaluation.
5. **Compromising on the Definition of Done:**
   * Do not mark work as "done" if it doesn't meet all aspects of the DoD. This leads to technical debt and potential issues later.
6. **Gold Plating:**
   * Avoid adding extra features or polish beyond what was agreed upon for the PBIs in the Sprint Backlog, especially if it jeopardizes the Sprint Goal.
7. **Letting the Sprint Board Get Stale:**
   * An outdated sprint board reduces transparency and makes Daily Stand-ups less effective. Update it regularly.
8. **Saving All Testing/Integration Until the End:**
   * This is a common anti-pattern that leads to a rush and potential quality issues at the end of the Sprint. Integrate and test continuously.
9. **Fear of Asking for Help:**
   * Foster an environment where it's safe and encouraged to ask for help when stuck. As Abhinav mentioned, if stuck for more than 30 minutes, talk to someone.
