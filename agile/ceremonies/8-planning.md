# Sprint Planning: Practices & Agenda

## 1. Overview & Purpose:**

* Sprint Planning is a collaborative event where the entire Agile Team (Product Owner and Engineers) defines what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and how that work will be achieved.
* It aims to create a shared understanding and agreement on the Sprint Goal and the selection of Product Backlog Items (PBIs) that form the Sprint Backlog.

## 2. Objectives of Sprint Planning:**

* **Define the Sprint Goal:** Craft a common, concise objective for the Sprint that provides focus and direction.
* **Establish Team Capacity:** Determine the team's actual availability for the Sprint.
* **Select Work (Sprint Forecast):** The Engineers select an appropriate amount of work from the "Ready" items in the Product Backlog to include in the Sprint Backlog, based on their capacity and past performance (velocity), and the high priorities defined based on the roadmap.
* **Plan the "How":** For the selected PBIs, the Engineers create an initial plan for how they will accomplish the work, often by breaking items down into smaller tasks.
* **Produce a Sprint Forecast:** The Sprint Backlog plus the Sprint Goal constitute the forecast of what the team aims to deliver.

## 3. Pre-requisites for Effective Sprint Planning:**

* **"Ready" Product Backlog Items:** A sufficient number of high-priority PBIs must meet the team's **Definition of Ready (DoR)**. This means they are clear, understood, estimated, and have Acceptance Criteria (AC) and a Definition of Done (DoD).
* **Roadmap Context:** The team should have visibility into the product roadmap, ideally looking at least three sprints ahead, to inform the Sprint Goal and PBI selection.
* **Latest Team Velocity:** Understanding of the team's recent, sustainable velocity (e.g., average of the last 3 rolling sprints).

## 4. Key Activities & Best Practices During Sprint Planning:**

* **A. Set the Stage (Understand Context & Capacity):**
  * **Review Product Roadmap/Priorities:** The Product Owner presents the highest priority items from the Product Backlog and discusses how they align with the broader product vision and roadmap.
  * **Establish Team Capacity:**
    * Each team member declares their availability for the sprint, accounting for vacations, holidays, and other commitments.
    * Allocate a pre-agreed portion of capacity for unpointed work like Spikes and Productivity tasks (e.g., 20-25% for productivity). This capacity is then "reserved."
* **B. Define the Sprint Goal:**
  * Collaboratively craft a clear, concise Sprint Goal that provides a shared objective for the Sprint.
  * The Sprint Goal should be specific and help guide the team's decisions throughout the Sprint.
  * **Avoid randomized goals** that lead to context switching and loss of productivity. The goal should provide focus.
* **C. Select Product Backlog Items (Sprint Forecast):**
  * **Engineers Pull Work:** Based on the Sprint Goal and their available capacity (after accounting for unpointed work), the Engineers pull "Ready" PBIs from the top of the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog.
  * **Use Velocity as a Guide:** Leverage the team's historical velocity (e.g., 3-sprint rolling average) to forecast how much work can realistically be taken on.
  * **Do Not Overcommit:** Be realistic. It's better to commit to a manageable amount of work and deliver it successfully than to overcommit and fail to meet the Sprint Goal. Do not add items the team believes cannot be completed within the sprint.
  * **Only "Ready" Items:** Strictly adhere to pulling only items that meet the Definition of Ready.
* **D. Plan the Work (The "How"):**
  * For each selected PBI, the Engineers discuss and create an initial plan for how to implement it. This often involves breaking down PBIs into smaller, actionable tasks (e.g., sub-tasks in JIRA).
  * This is not meant to be an exhaustive design session but enough for the team to feel confident they can start the work.
  * **Prioritize Collaboration:** Encourage discussion and collaboration during this phase. Avoid individuals working in silos. If a task seems too complex for one person, consider pairing or swarming.
* **E. Handling Carry-Over and Blocked Items:**
  * **Unfinished Items (Carry-Over):**
    * Discuss any work not completed in the previous sprint.
    * Evaluate if these items are still relevant and high priority.
    * **Consider re-estimation and re-prioritization.** If an item was significantly misunderstood or its scope changed, it might need to be re-groomed and re-estimated. Consider if it needs to be split.
  * **Blocked Items:**
    * If an item selected for the sprint becomes blocked, the team should discuss mitigation strategies.
    * For items blocked *before* planning: If a high-priority item is blocked, consider creating a related ticket (e.g., a Spike or a task for another team) to unblock it. This unblocking ticket might become part of the current sprint if feasible and the DoR is met.
    * **Be wary of repeatedly carrying over blocked items.** If an item has been blocked for multiple sprints (e.g., \>2 sprints), critically evaluate its relevance and feasibility. Make sure to leave a meaningful update before abandoning or deferring it significantly.
  * **Scope Stability:** Try to avoid adding new work or significantly changing the scope of items *during* the sprint. If strictly necessary, it requires discussion with the Product Owner and team.

## 5. Participants:**

* **Product Owner:** Presents priorities, clarifies PBIs, collaborates on the Sprint Goal, and is available to answer questions.
* **Engineers (Development Team):** Determine capacity, select PBIs, plan the work (task breakdown), and commit to the Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog.
* **Scrum Master (if applicable):** Facilitates the meeting, ensures it stays within the timebox, and helps the team apply Agile principles.

## 6. Outcomes of Sprint Planning:**

* **A Sprint Goal:** A clear, shared objective for the Sprint.
* **The Sprint Backlog:** The set of Product Backlog Items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering them and achieving the Sprint Goal.
* **Shared Commitment:** The team has a shared understanding of and commitment to the Sprint Goal and the work in the Sprint Backlog.
* **Increased Confidence:** The team feels confident that the selected work is achievable.

## 7. Timing and Cadence (from previous Grooming doc, relevant here):**

* **Frequency:** Occurs once per sprint, at the beginning of the sprint.
* **Scheduling Example:** If sprints are two weeks, sprint planning might be on a Wednesday morning, following a grooming session earlier in the week (e.g., Monday).
