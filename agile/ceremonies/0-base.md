# General Guiding Principle for Ceremonies and Processes

* **Clear Purpose, Flexible Process:** The goals and purpose of each meeting must be clear to all participants. However, avoid creating an overly rigid process that stifles discussion. While having high-level agenda items is important, maintain an open-ended approach to allow for emergent topics and valuable conversation.

* **Shared Understanding & Commitment:** The DoD is a mutual agreement and commitment by the entire team. It should be clear, visible, and consistently applied.

* **Clarity and Communication:** Git history should be clear, understandable, and tell a story of the project's evolution. Conventions are not just rules for rules' sake; they are tools for better team communication and collaboration.

* **Traceability:** All significant work should be traceable back to a requirement or task, typically a JIRA ticket.
