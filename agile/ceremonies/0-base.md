# Our Approach to Software Development: Guiding Principles

This document outlines our team's agreed-upon practices and processes for the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Our approach is rooted in Agile principles, emphasizing collaboration, continuous improvement, and the consistent delivery of value.

**Our Core Objectives (The "Why"):**

* **Agile Foundation:** We adhere to the Agile manifesto, valuing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
* **Shared Understanding:** We strive to build a uniform language and a set of meaningful, collectively owned practices that are clear to all team members.
* **Accelerated Value:** Our processes aim to accelerate the delivery of valuable and high-quality increments to our users and the business.
* **Data-Informed Decisions:** We support a culture of consistent measurement to understand our performance and guide improvements.
* **Leverage Modern Tools:** We aim to utilize tools, including AI, to enhance the quality and efficiency of our documentation and development artifacts.
* **Guidance, Not Dogma:** The templates and processes described herein serve as points of reference and agreed-upon starting points, not as an overly rigid set of instructions that stifles adaptation.

> "following processes is about practices, if the practice does not work change the process"

**Our Methods (The "How"):**

* **Practice & Discipline:** We develop "muscle memory" around effective practices through consistent application, discipline, and transparency.
* **Automation Focus:** We are committed to automating repetitive tasks wherever feasible to improve efficiency and reduce manual error.
* **Streamlined Artifacts:** We use tools, including AI, to streamline the creation and maintenance of essential development artifacts, ensuring they are valuable and not overly burdensome.

**Key Considerations & Mindset:**

* **Iterative Evolution:** Our "Way of Work" is an evolving process. We embrace an iterative mindset, continuously inspecting our practices and adapting them for greater effectiveness. If a practice isn't working, we commit to changing the process.
* **Clear Purpose, Flexible Process:** While the goals of our ceremonies and processes are clearly defined, we maintain flexibility to adapt to specific contexts and encourage open discussion to address emergent needs.
* **Shared Responsibility & Ownership:** All team members—not just developers—share responsibility for adhering to, supporting, and critically re-evaluating these practices. Our artifacts and ceremonies represent mutual agreements and commitments.
* **Clarity and Communication:** We believe our work history (e.g., in Git, JIRA) should tell a clear and understandable story. Our conventions are tools for better team communication and collaboration.
* **Traceability:** All significant work must be traceable back to its originating requirement or task, typically documented in a JIRA ticket, ensuring transparency and context.

This document will detail the specific ceremonies and processes that guide our daily work, from initial intake to final release.
