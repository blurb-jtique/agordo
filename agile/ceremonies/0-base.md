# General Guiding Principle for Ceremonies and Processes

## Goals - Why

- Follow the Agile manifesto as fundamental approach
- Build a uniform language and meaningful practices
- Leverage AI to enforce high quality documentation that matters
- Support a consistent measuring culture
- Acelerate valuable deliverables
- Provide templates as points of reference not rigid set of instructions

## How

- Developing muscle memory on practices that really matters
- Automating everything that could be automated
- Using AI to streamline the artifacts building

## Considerations

* **Iterative minset:** this is an evolving process trying to develop muscle memory but being disciplined and transparency to guarantee consistency and relevance.

* **Clear Purpose, Flexible Process:** The goals and purpose of each meeting must be clear to all participants. However, avoid creating an overly rigid process that stifles discussion. While having high-level agenda items is important, maintain an open-ended approach to allow for emergent topics and valuable conversation.

following processes is about practices, if the practice does not work change the process

* **Shared responsibilities:** all individual and interactions should have shared responsibility about adhering to this set of practices, supporting them and re-evaluating them, this is not only for devs but for the whole team.

* **Shared Understanding & Commitment:** The artifacts and ceremonies are a mutual agreement and commitment by the entire team. They should be clear, visible, and consistently applied and reviewed.

* **Clarity and Communication:** History should be clear, understandable, and tell a story of the project's evolution. Conventions are not just rules for rules' sake; they are tools for better team communication and collaboration.

* **Traceability:** All significant work should be traceable back to a requirement or task, typically a JIRA ticket.
