BBF
===

BBF stands for "Blurb Book Format." It is a format used primarily by Blurb's BookWright and Online Ebook Editor for creating and managing book projects. BBF can be represented in either XML or JSON formats, and there is a Ruby gem called "bbf" that handles parsing, serialization, and conversion between these formats. The BBF format is used to produce fixed-layout ebooks compatible with platforms like iBooks, and it supports conversion to epub and Kindle mobi files through tools like bbf_to_ebook and ebookgen
