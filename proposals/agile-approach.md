To insert images locally in your markdown file, you can use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](relative/path/to/image.png)
```

For example, if you have an image named `diagram.png` in the same directory as your markdown file, you would write:

```markdown
![Diagram](./diagram.png)
```

If the image is in a subdirectory called `images`, you would write:

```markdown
![Diagram](./images/diagram.png)
```

## Interface

Definition: The product connects to users, systems, and devices through interfaces to exchange data.
Key Questions:
- What interfaces are needed for users (human or otherwise) to interact with the product?
- How does the product receive and send data?
Goal: Design effective mechanisms for interaction and data exchange.

## Action
