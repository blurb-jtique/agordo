## 1. Assessment Risk Matrix Overview

Scale used:

- **Likelihood**: Rare (1), Unlikely (2), Possible (3), Likely (4), Almost Certain (5)  
- **Impact**: Insignificant (1), Minor (2), Moderate (3), Major (4), Catastrophic (5)

**Risk Score** = Likelihood × Impact

Suggested interpretation:

- **1–4** = Low  
- **5–9** = Medium  
- **10–14** = High (or Medium-High)  
- **15–19** = High  
- **20–25** = Critical  

Below is a **summary table**, followed by explanations of each risk category.

## 2. Explanation of Changes and Current Mitigations
### 1. Legacy Ruby Stack & Compatibility
- **Score**: 16 (High)  
- **Rationale**:  
  - The **phased approach** (Phase 0 and Phase 1 especially) ensures early identification of gem or library incompatibilities, slightly reducing the likelihood of “unknown unknowns.”  
  - However, Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 2 remain **end-of-life**, with no official security patches. That keeps **impact** and **likelihood** high overall.  
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough container testing in dev/staging, fallback to VMs if containerization fails.

### 2. Large File Handling & Storage
- **Score**: 12 (High/Medium‑High)  
- **Rationale**:  
  - The plan to use a **hybrid** storage approach (NFS, object storage, or ephemeral volumes) during containerization still poses complexity.  
  - By detailing this in **Phase 1** (dev/test) and **Phase 2** (staging) with advanced load tests, we reduce the risk of last-minute surprises.  
  - Still, improper configuration could cause **data loss** or **performance hits**, keeping it High.  
  - **Mitigation**: Early file-handling validation in Phase 1, plus advanced load/stress testing in Phase 2.

### 3. DB Connectivity & Networking
- **Score**: 16 (High)  
- **Rationale**:  
  - Network/firewall complexities remain a major unknown for on-prem setups.  
  - The new roadmap includes **staging environment** that mirrors production (Phase 2) and thorough **blue-green/canary** approaches (Phase 3). This lowers the chance of being blindsided in production.  
  - However, the risk is still High because any misconfiguration can bring the system down (Major impact).  
  - **Mitigation**: Early collaboration with network/security teams, partial DR/rollback drills in Phase 2.

### 4. CI/CD & Release Management
- **Score**: 9 (Medium)  
- **Rationale**:  
  - The detailed plan for **Phase 0** (picking Jenkins vs. TeamCity, versioning strategy) and **Phase 1** (integrating container builds, automated tests) significantly reduces both the probability of pipeline chaos and its impact. However the cherry-picking merging issue could give us problems.  
  - But because it doesn't directly threaten production uptime (errors are mostly caught pre-deployment), we can rate it as Medium now.  
  - **Mitigation**: Well-defined container build and test pipelines with scanning or linting to detect image issues early.

### 5. Deployment & Downtime Constraints
- **Score**: 20 (Critical)  
- **Rationale**:  
  - Despite the robust **blue-green** or **canary** plan, the business requires **near-zero downtime** and has multiple **seasonal peaks**.  
  - A failure in the production cutover (Phase 3) could lead to catastrophic downtime if rollback or DR procedures falter.  
  - The plan includes robust DR drills, but the **impact** of an outage remains catastrophic, so overall we keep this as Critical.  
  - **Mitigation**: Rehearsed rollback paths, parallel VM environment, repeated fire drills before peak seasons.

### 6. Performance Testing Gaps
- **Score**: 9 (Medium)  
- **Rationale**:  
  - Phase 2 and Phase 3 incorporate more thorough load/stress testing in a staging environment. This reduces the likelihood of undiscovered performance bottlenecks.  
  - However, a possible partial DevOps availability means some advanced or repeated testing might not happen if timelines slip.
  - **Mitigation**: Implementation of JMeter/Locust tests, continuous observation with NewRelic, and real-world canary traffic in Phase 3.

### 7. Organizational & Timeline Constraints
- **Score**: 16 (High)  
- **Rationale**:  
  - The updated 5-phase roadmap includes fallback plans (e.g., remain on VMs for first seasonal peak if containerization isn't ready). That lowers the catastrophic potential if deadlines slip.  
  - However, a possible partial DevOps availability still threatens timely completion. A delay can cause friction with business demands and the parallel new platform development.  
  - the plan includes incremental sign-offs (Phases 0–3) and fallback approaches.  
  - **Mitigation**: Realistic scheduling, partial parallelization, and clear escalation if the timeline starts slipping.

### 8. Security & Compliance Oversight
- **Score**: 12 (High/Medium‑High)  
- **Rationale**:  
  - Container scanning, updated DR procedures, and a dedicated plan for secrets management in Phase 0–2 reduce the probability of major security gaps.  
  - However, the old Ruby stack still harbors potential unpatched vulnerabilities. Overall Impact is still Major, but we mark Likelihood as Possible rather than Likely now that scanning and structured patching are on the plan.  
  - **Mitigation**: Ongoing scanning (Trivy/Anchore), secure secrets management, plus actively monitoring OS/package CVEs.

```

- **(5)**: Deployment & Downtime Constraints (score 20) – at (4×5) in the matrix  
- **(1,3,7)**: Legacy Ruby Stack (16), DB Connectivity (16), Org & Timeline (16) – all at (4×4)  
- **(2,8)**: Large File Handling (12), Security & Compliance (12) – at (3×4) or (4×3) depending on how we visualize the grid  
- **(4,6)**: CI/CD & Release (9), Perf Testing Gaps (9) – at (3×3)

## 4. Summary & Next Steps

- **Top Critical Risk**: 
  - **Deployment & Downtime Constraints (#5)** remains at **Critical (20)**, reflecting the catastrophic impact of an outage or failed production cutover.

- **High Risks (16 or 12)**:
  - **Legacy Ruby Stack (#1), DB Connectivity (#3), Organizational Constraints (#7), Large File Handling (#2), and Security (#8)** each remain high priority.  
  - The 5-phase plan **lowers** certain likelihoods (particularly organizational constraints, security gaps) but they still pose serious challenges if not carefully managed.

- **Medium Risks (9)**:
  - **CI/CD (#4) and Performance Testing Gaps (#6)** are Medium under the revised approach (phased dev/staging, robust pipeline planning).

### Mitigation Highlights in the Updated Plan

1. **Phased Rollouts** (Dev/Test → Staging → Production Pilot) reduce the chances of big-bang surprises.  
2. **Detailed DR Drills** in Phase 2 (staging) and Phase 3 (production pilot) address the critical nature of downtime.  
3. **Fallback to VMs** for the first seasonal peak if container readiness is delayed, mitigating catastrophic scenario.  
4. **Active Monitoring & Scanning** across phases ensures that security vulnerabilities are less likely to go unnoticed.
