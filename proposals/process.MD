Below is a **generic** version of the **onboarding and checklist process** we followed in RPI/Blurb a modernization project with a distributed legacy architecture.

> **Note**: Whenever you see specific tool or account references (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Jenkins), assume they are **examples** that can be replaced with alternatives depending on your organization’s environment.

## **1. Gathering Background & Forming the Checklist**

1. **Collect Documentation & Transcripts**  
   - **Action:** Gather meeting notes, recordings, transcripts, architectural diagrams, Slack/email threads.  
   - **Goal:** Summarize existing systems (legacy code, microservices, data flows), identify main pain points, and define relevant SME areas.  
   - **Generic Example:** Use your communication tool to record and transcribe the meetings asking for permission to do that

2. **Define Stakeholders & Roles**  
   - **Action:** Identify key stakeholders and communication hierarchy.DevOps lead, product owners, data/BI specialists, security experts, lead engineers, etc.  
   - **Goal:** Know who can answer environment, architecture, testing, or business-flow questions.  
   - **Generic Example:** \[TEAM = \{DevOps Manager, Security SME, DB/BI Specialist, Legacy Code Owner, etc.\}\]

3. **Assemble a Master Onboarding Checklist**  
   - **Action:** Merge typical onboarding items (environment readiness, security, data, business flows) with specific items from transcripts or unique domain concerns (containerization, compliance, etc.).  
   - **Goal:** A consolidated list of required knowledge and tasks to systematically address.

## **2. Accounts/Platforms/Tools Inventory**

**Objective:** Ensure all required **credentials**, **access rights**, and **policies** are known or set up so the new team can be productive. The inventory typically covers:

1. **Project Management**  
   - **Examples**: Jira, Azure DevOps, Trello, or ClickUp.  
   - **Actions**: Create new user accounts, assign roles (Developer, QA, etc.), verify access to the backlog or boards.

2. **Observability & Monitoring**  
   - **Examples**: Datadog, Grafana, Splunk, or in-house dashboards.  
   - **Actions**: Provide credentials for dashboards, set up relevant alerts, ensure read/write privileges if needed.

3. **Git Repositories / Code Platforms**  
   - **Examples**: GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab.  
   - **Actions**: Confirm the new team members can clone, push, and create PRs in relevant repos (main monolith, microservices).

4. **Communication & Notification Channels**  
   - **Examples**: Slack, MS Teams, email groups, PagerDuty.  
   - **Actions**: Join relevant channels, set up on-call or incident escalations, define how code or system notifications are broadcast.

5. **Infrastructure & Environment Access**  
   - **Examples**: Jenkins, TeamCity, Docker registries, AWS/ECS, On-Prem VMWare, or Kubernetes clusters.  
   - **Actions**: Configure user accounts for pipeline orchestration, container registries, or ephemeral test environments.

6. **Identity & Policy**  
   - **Examples**: SSO solutions (Okta, Keycloak), internal LDAP, or AD-based domain credentials.  
   - **Actions**: Verify roles in organizational SSO, define password rotations or MFA requirements.

7. **Password & Secret Management**  
   - **Examples**: Vault, LastPass, 1Password, Key Management Service.  
   - **Actions**: Provide secure login or tokens for microservices, environment variables, or DB credentials.  
   - **Generic Tip**: Usually needs sign-off from Security/Compliance if dealing with older OS or code references.

## **3. Structuring the SME (Subject Matter Expert) Meetings**

1. **Kickoff / Overview Session**  
   - **Purpose:** A broad, high-level orientation to the business goals, codebase overview, big challenges (e.g., containerization, security holes).  
   - **Typical SMEs**: The director or lead engineer plus product manager for an overarching vision.

2. **Technical Processes Gathering (Deep-Dive)**
   - **Code Reviewing and Merges**  
     - **Attendees**: QA lead or senior dev.  
     - **Topics**: DoD, DoR, documentation, conventions, branch strategy, support channels and reviewers, reviewing steps and policies, quality gates. 
   - **DevOps & Containerization**  
     - **Attendees**: DevOps lead, new engineers, possibly a legacy infra manager.  
     - **Topics**: Docker feasibility, AWS or on-prem, OS patching vs container approach, Automated pipelines, networking constraints.  
   - **Testing Strategy**  
     - **Attendees**: QA lead or senior dev, new sustain engineers.  
     - **Topics**: Automated test frameworks, coverage, environment setup for local vs. pipeline test runs.  
   - **Business Activities Journey & Flows** (Michael, Padraic, Melissa)  
     - **Attendees**: Operations or product support managers (for user flows, distribution logic), plus maybe BI specialists.  
     - **Topics**: Legacy e-commerce workflows, distribution to external parties, user account flows, day-to-day usage patterns.

3. **Security**  
   - **Attendees**: Security SMEs, possibly the DevOps security champion.  
   - **Topics**: principles, practices,fraud, IP blocking, process integrities, compliance needs, logging/monitoring.

4. **Database & BI**  
   - **Attendees**: DBA or data engineer, new devs.  
   - **Topics**: Data schema overview, user spam infiltration, partial vs. full DB cleanups, how business intelligence is done (ETL tools, queries, etc.).

5. **Architecture & PlantUML**  
   - **Attendees**: Everyone or the lead architects, new devs.  
   - **Topics**: Review partial diagrams, gather clarifications, produce a final high-level diagram (and possibly a more detailed version for calls & data flows).

## **4. Converging on the Initial Roadmap**

1. **Consolidate Answers to Checklist**
   - Using the TEAM checklist and the RAG assessment to decide if we are ready to move toward the next phase
   - **Example**:  
     - *Environment Readiness?* → Laptops, VPN, Jenkins, AWS done.
     - *Way of work?* → Practices, workflows, standards.
     - *Security Approach?* → Proposed containerization or patching.  
     - *Business Flows?* → Understood distribution & user onboarding.  
     - *Testing & QA?* → Found frameworks, coverage gaps, next steps.  
     - *Database State?* → Junk user accounts, partial cleanup plan.

2. **Prioritize High-Impact Tasks**  
   - **Short-Term**: e.g., environment fixes, simplest containerization of services, partial DB cleanup, bridging any urgent security hole.  
   - **Mid-Term**: e.g., Possibly expand containerization to monolith (if feasible), larger DB purges with better user validations, incorporate testing improvements.  
   - **Long-Term**: e.g., Migrate final legacy pieces to new OS or new platform, integrate deeper with next-gen architecture.

3. **Share & Iterate**  
   - **Action**: Present the initial roadmap to stakeholders (director, product leads, dev managers).  
   - **Outcome**: Adjust based on real business priorities (like shipping fixes, holiday readiness, or big distribution demands).

### **Summary**

In **resuming** the entire discussion and **process**:

- We **analyzed** transcripts & onboarding calls with ChatGPT.  
- **Mapped** them to a **structured checklist**: environment and accounts inventory, architecture clarifications, security approaches, database state, and business flows.  
- **Held** SME deep-dive sessions:
  1) Code reviews / merging,
  2) DevOps/Containerization,  
  3) Testing & QA,  
  4) Business Activities & Distribution Flows,  
  5) Security,  
  6) Database/BI.
- **Answer** TEAM checklist questions
- **Built** or refined a **high-level PlantUML** architecture diagram, then a more detailed version.  
- **Drafted** an **initial roadmap** (short-, mid-, long-term) combining environment readiness, partial fixes, data cleanup, containerization feasibility, and eventual integration or replacement with next-gen systems.  
- **Generic** enough for re-use in **similar legacy** modernization or **sustaining engineering** projects, enabling a structured approach from **knowledge capture** through **roadmap** creation.
